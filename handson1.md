# Hands-on, part 1

In this hands-on assignment, each group shall create a mesh of the object to
simulate. Some groups are assigned a sphere, while others are assigned a
cylinder. All groups will simulate the object in a plasma with the following
parameters:

- Electron and ion density: 1e11 /m^3
- Electron and ion temperature: 1000 K (=0.08617 eV)

This is representative of the F-layer ionosphere. The object has the following
dimensions:

- Sphere: Radius of 0.5 Debye length
- Cylinder: Radius of 0.2 Debye lengths, and a length of 10 Debye lengths

You may find the files in the Geometry folder helpful to start with.

Let the lower and upper half of the object be two distinct physical groups,
such that different voltages can be assigned to them in PTetra.

Try to guess the answer to the following questions:

- How large do you think the outer boundary needs to be?
- What resolution do you need on the inner and outer boundary?

We will provide you with reasonable answers before you proceed.

Although each group only needs one mesh (to begin with), we encourage all
participants to try creating this mesh, asking their group for help before
asking the organizers.
